            <p class="rules-illustration">A game with very few cards, so a very easy game specially designed for kids. The cards are arranged in <span class="rules-info">4 columns</span> and <span class="rules-info">4 rows</span> for a total of <span class="rules-info">16 cards</span> or <span class="rules-info">8 pairs</span>. You have to Reconstruct the pairs of cards by turning them 2 by 2. If the cards turned face up are the same (a pair) you win and the pair disappears from the game otherwise the cards are automatically turned face down and you need to make a new try. Find all the pairs in the least moves and in a shortest time. You will find the full rule of the memory game here.
            Every time you start a new game, a random selection of the cards ensures a different game, so you can replay endlessly.</p>
